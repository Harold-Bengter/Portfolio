                    on RapidAPI. To use this you have to enter a gamertag on a given platform that then gives you <br>
                    a token. Once you have this token you can display specific information about the gamertag such <br>
                    as kill/death ratio, time played, game played, etc. For a more indepth look please visit my github!
